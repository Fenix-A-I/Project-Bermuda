Greetings!

We've been tasked with performing a pentest to ensure that our target is not
vulnerable to password spray attacks. We've spent the last few weeks performing
OSINT, and we've extracted some useful information about our target. We've found
    - An ssh server on port 2222 on the server `target.uosec`
    - A list of possible users, in `users.lst`
We've also discovered that when user accounts are created, the password is set to
a kind of pie until the user gets around to changing their password. Your task is
to conduct a password spray attack against the ssh server using those users and
the list of pies found in `pies.lst`

You have a full Kali Linux system here, and I've preinstalled `hydra`, which is probably
the tool you want to use. For information on using hydra for password sprays, check out

Good luck!
