Introduction:
Bermuda is a gateway that will act as a foundation for a capture the flag experience. It will securely authenticate users, store credentials for them to have their own linux environment, and track progress in challenges. The only user roles currently are participants, there are no administrator roles. 

Getting Started:
User will navigate to https://terminal-development.uosec.org/ where they will first be directed to log in with their Univserity of Oregon email. Any email problems should be solved through their microsoft account. 

Using the Platform:
After a user successfully authenticates they will be able to access three different pages. On the first page they can store ssh keys in order to run the terminal in their own environment. The terminal page will pull up a cali linux terminal on the browswer. The challgne page states all the challenges and shows progress.
